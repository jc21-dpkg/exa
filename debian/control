Description: exa is a modern replacement for ls. It uses colours for information by default,
  helping you distinguish between many types of files, such as whether you are
  the owner, or in the owning group. It also has extra features not present in
  the original ls, such as viewing the Git status for a directory, or recursing
  into directories with a tree view. exa is written in Rust, so it's small,
  fast, and portable.
